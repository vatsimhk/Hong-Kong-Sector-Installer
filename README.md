# Hong-Kong-Sector-Installer

A basic installer app that installs and updates the Hong Kong Sector Package. Using the libgit2 library, it fetches updates from the Hong-Kong-Sector-Package git repository, then pulls them and merges them with local changes, to preserve user customisations.

Build using qt 6.6 and libqgit2.
