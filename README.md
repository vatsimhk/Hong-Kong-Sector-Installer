## New Installation
Select the "Install Sector Package" option, select the folder you wish to save the files in, and the installer will create a folder called "Hong-Kong-Sector-Package" and download the sector package into that folder.
Once installed, open EuroScope, and select "Hong Kong TOPSKY.prf" to open the default profile.

## Updating
Select the "Update Sector Package" option, select the folder containing your Hong Kong Sector Package, and the installer will check for updates from the github repository. If updates are found, it will download them and merge them with your personal settings. If conflicts are detected, the installer will prompt you and resolve them automatically, or you can choose to resolve the conflicts manually (recommended for experienced controllers only). 

## Migrating Old Installations
For controllers who have previously installed the sector package with a zip file, select the "Migrate Old Installation" option, select the folder containing your Hong Kong Sector Package, and the installer will download the latest version of the sector package and merge them with your old installation. If conflicts are detected, the installer will prompt you and resolve them automatically, or you can choose to resolve the conflicts manually (recommended for experienced controllers only). A backup of your installation will be created in a folder named "Hong-Kong-Sector (Old Backup" in case the merge messes up some of your files.
